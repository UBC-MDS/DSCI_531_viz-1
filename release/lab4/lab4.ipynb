    "\n",
    "This \"tooling\" lab assignment was designed to give you practice using Python to create graphs. You'll be making four plots, twice: once using `matplotlib` with `pandas`, and another using `seaborn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have to wrangle some data to make some of the plots. You are welcome to do this with R if you'd like. If so, you can write the wrangled data to file, then read into Python; alternatively, you can call R from python using the [`rpy2` package](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-2.1/html/introduction.html)."
