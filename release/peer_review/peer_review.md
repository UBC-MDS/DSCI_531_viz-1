# DSCI 531: Peer Review

Due Wednesday, Nov 7 at 18:00 (although you should be able to finish in lecture).

## Objective

You and your hackathon team members are to provide feedback on another hackathon team's graph -- or at least, whatever they have of the graph!

## The Feedback Session

Between 0940-0956 in Lecture 8, you will be engaging in a feedback session, composed of three stages:

1. **Fly-on-the-wall** (we suggest 1 minute): The reviewers verbally communicate what they learn from the graph, _without any input from the creators_, while the creators watch. The reviewers should speak their thought process -- "think out loud", but the creators can't talk, and can't even gesture!
2. **Informed-run** (we suggest 1 minute): The creators fill the reviewers in on the graph's intended message.
3. **Written + Verbal feedback** (we suggest 5 minutes): The reviewers write feedback as a github issue on one of the reviewee's hackathon repos. 

## Tips on giving feedback:

Your feedback only needs to be a "brain dump" (doesn't need polishing). But it should still be thoughtful and useful. Here are some tips on giving feedback:

* State what's good about the work. Why is it good? State what needs improvement. Why does it need improvement? But never charge those things with emotion. Be objective.
* Feedback should offer _suggestions_ on how to improve the vis in addition to noting weaknesses of the current version.
* There's always something that can be said! It's okay to give feedback about the strong parts of the vis, however a vis can always be improved.

## What you should submit here
