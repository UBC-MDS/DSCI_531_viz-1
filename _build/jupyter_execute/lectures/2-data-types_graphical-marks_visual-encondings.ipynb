    "A bar chart is a good choice for representing summary statistics\n",
    "such as counts of observations and summations\n",
    "The reason for this is that for such data,\n",
    "a single summary statistic can well describe it.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "the height of a bar in a bar chart\n",
    "can clearly communicate the number of people living in a country\n",
    "at a specific point in time.\n",
    "There is no missing information here\n",
    "that we might need to communicate using another mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar charts are often avoided when visualizing summary statistics\n",
    "such as the mean and median,\n",
    "as the purpose of these summary statistics\n",
    "is to describe a distribution.\n",
    "However,\n",
    "the mean and median only describe one aspect of a distribution\n",
    "(the central tendency, meaning where most values are found).\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "to graphically depict a distribution\n",
    "we also need to illustrate the spread of the distribution\n",
    "(the range of the values that were observed).\n",
    "We will cover how to effectively visualize this later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of this from a [scientific article on how to present data accurately](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128).\n",
    "The bars in A show the mean and standard error\n",
    "of all the different set of points in the panels B-E.\n",
    "This is an example of how bar charts could hide widely different data distributions,\n",
    "which would lead to different interpretations of the experiment\n",
    "both visually from looking at the points\n",
    "and by examining formal statistical comparisons\n",
    "(the table below the figure,\n",

    "  e.g. bimodality might not show up since a single bin covers both peaks.\n",
