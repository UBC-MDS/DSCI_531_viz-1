# Participation Assessment

rubric={raw:7}

## Purpose

The intent of the participation assessment is to give students practice addressing many questions that each have narrow scope. This is as opposed to the labs, where you work on fewer questions with larger scope. 

There are two goals:

1. Help students grasp smaller concepts as they are encountered in lecture.
2. Give students a foundation for approaching the lab assignments.

## Evaluation

Your participation will be evaluated by submitting work on in-class activities to your participation repository for this course. You can find your participation repo the same way you find your lab repo's.

What we're grading:

- You receive 1 participation point for every lecture you "participate" in, for a maximum of 7 points.
	- You are allowed to miss one lecture's participation.
- Participation _is not_ evaluated based on correctness. 
- Participation _is_ evaluated based on whether or not the _attempt_ was there (as determined by the commit history and presence of work files). 

Be sure to make your repository navigable and understandable. Up to one point can be deducted if it's not.
