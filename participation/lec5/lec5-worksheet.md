# DSCI 531 Lecture 5 Worksheet

Each time we visit the worksheet in class, do the following:

1. Pair up with your neighbour
    - I recommend changing to your other neighbour each time we revisit this worksheet
2. With your partner, choose from the following:
    - Choose a graph at <http://viz.wtf/>:
        - Link to the graph.
        - Discuss with your partner how you would make the graph more effective; record a summary.
        - Similarly, discuss and record what was originally ineffective with the graph.
    - OR, choose a graph or a tip from the lecture notes:
        - Indicate which graph/tip it is you're referring to.
        - Discuss with your partner whether you agree or disagree, or if you'd do something different; record a summary.
3. Share with the class
